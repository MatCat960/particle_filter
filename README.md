# particle_filter

This repo contains a C++ library for Particle Filter Localization.
The library does not include ROS dependencies, but the package provides a ROS wrapper node for ROS integration.

Code Example: [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)]([https://colab.research.google.com/drive/16F_hXnZ7kelZXz1Km6rEIRhC3zlmKq1e?usp=sharing)])

## Dependencies

 - Eigen3

## ROS Wrapper Usage
Set desired parameters and topic names in `pf_test.launch`:

**Parameters:**

 - `GRAPHICS_ON <bool>` - if `true`, poses of each particles are published as a `visualization_msgs/MarkerArray` allowing visualization with graphical tools (e.g. RViz).
 - `USE_GROUND_TRUTH <bool>` - if `true`, the node subscribes to the `/ground_truth` topic and provides a comparison between real and estimated position.
 - `VERBOSE <bool>` - if `true`, the node prints information about each particle's pose, estimated position, ...
  - `FILE_PATH <string>` - global path of the `.txt` file containing global known positions of landmarks.

**Topics**

- `/cmd_vel_in  <geometry_msgs/Twist>` - read velocity from this topic in order to calculate motion according to the desired kinematic model.
- `/detections_topic <geometry_msgs/PoseArray>` - get relative position of detected landmarks from the vision system. *Warning:*  the message received from this topic must contain an array of poses, where the i-th element of the array corresponds to the i-th landmark. **Undetected landmarks position must be set to (100.0, 100.0)**.
- `/ground_truth <nav_msgs/Odometry>` - *(only if USE_GROUND_TRUTH=true)* - ground truth topic from simulation engine.
- `/estimate_topic <nav_msgs/Odometry>` - topic where estimated pose is published.
- `/visual_particles <visualization_msgs/MarkerArray>` - *(only if GRAPHICS_ON=true)* - topic where visualization markers are published, representing position of each particle.  

## Particle Filter steps
A particle filter is a recursive Bayesian state estimator that uses discrete particles to approximate the posterior distribution of an estimated state. Its algorithm is useful for online state estimation of a non-linear system according to the dynamic model of the robot and measurements taken (see [[1]](#1)).

Process and measurement noise distribution are also taken into account, resulting in the definition of a probability distribution of the real robotâ€™s state. The procedure for particle filter state estimation is presented in details in [[2]](#2).

To summarize, we can define an initialization phase, followed by the recursive iteration over four steps: prediction, weight update, resampling, and state estimation.

 0. *Initialization*: A specific number of particles $P \in \mathbb{N}$ is generated according to a known distribution or uniformly distributed within the environment. Each particles represents an hypothesis of the state variables.
  ```math
  x(0)_{k} \sim p(x(0))
  ```  
In the above equation, $x(0)_k$ is the initial state of the generic particle $k$, $p(x(0))$ is the initial distribution and the operator $\sim$ is used to denote that the particle is randomly obtained from the probability distribution.
1. *Prediction*: The state of each particle is propagated following the state transition model of the system $f(x(t-1)_k, u(t))$, where $u(t)$ is the control input. The result is a new particles distribution.
```math
  x(t)_k = f(x(t-1)_k, u(t))
  ```  
2. *Weight update*: The likelihood of sensor measurements $y(t)$ is exploited to update the weight of each particle.
```math
  w(t)_k = p(y(t) | x(t)_k)
  ```  
3. *Resampling*: The particles are resampled according to their weights, in order to give more weight to particles that are more likely to match the observed data. This means that the new set of particles will be more concentrated in regions of the state space that have the highest probability.
4. *State Estimation*: The state estimate $\hat{x}(t)$ is calculated as a a weighted sum of particles.
```math
  \hat{x}(t) =  \frac{\sum w(t)_k x(t)_k}{\sum w(t)_k}
  ```  

Once the state estimate has been obtained, the algorithm jumps back at step 1 to start a new iteration.
